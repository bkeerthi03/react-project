# Zustand

## Differences between Zustand, Redux and Context API
### Redux:
* Use Redux for large-scale applications with <b>complex state management</b> needs.
* Choose Redux if you require strict data flow and a well-defined architecture.
* Redux is an excellent choice for projects with a large development team and the need for standardized state management practices.
### Zustand:
* Zustand is best suited for smaller applications or specific components with localized state needs.
* Consider Zustand when you prefer a lightweight state management solution with minimal setup.
* Zustand is ideal for projects where simplicity and performance are essential.
### Context API:
* Use Context API for small applications or when managing state within individual components.
* Context API is a good choice when you want a built-in, easy-to-use state management solution with less complexity.
* Context API is well-suited for scenarios where global state management is not a primary concern.
