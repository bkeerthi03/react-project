# Zustand

## Differences between Zustand, Redux and Context API
### Redux:
* Use Redux for <b>large-scale applications</b> with <b>complex state management</b> needs.
* Choose Redux if you require strict data flow and a <b>well-defined architecture</b>.
* Redux is an excellent choice for projects with a large development team and the need for standardized state management practices.
### Zustand:
* Zustand is best suited for <b>smaller applications or specific components with localized state</b> needs.
* Consider Zustand when you prefer a <b>lightweight state management</b> solution with <b>minimal setup</b>.
* Zustand is ideal for projects where simplicity and performance are essential.
### Context API:
* Use Context API for <b>small applications or when managing state within individual components.</b>
* Context API is a good choice when you want a built-in, <b>easy-to-use state management solution with less complexity.</b>
* Context API is well-suited for scenarios where <b>global state management is not a primary concern.</b>
