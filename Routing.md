# Using App Router

## Routing Fundamentals
* The skeleton of every application is routing.

### Terminology
* **Tree:** A convention for visualizing a hierarchical structure. For example, a component tree with parent and children components, a folder structure, etc.
* **Subtree:** Part of a tree, starting at a new root (first) and ending at the leaves (last).
* **Root:** The first node in a tree or subtree, such as a root layout.
* **Leaf:** Nodes in a subtree that have no children, such as the last segment in a URL path.
* **URL Segment:** Part of the URL path delimited by slashes.
* **URL Path:** Part of the URL that comes after the domain (composed of segments).

### The app Router
* The App Router works in a new directory named app

### Roles of Folders and Files
* Next.js uses a file-system based router where:
    * **Folders** are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the file-system hierarchy from the root folder down to a final leaf folder that includes a page.js file. See Defining Routes.
    * **Files** are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment. See special files.

### Route Segments
* Each folder in a route represents a route segment.
* Each route segment is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.

### Nested Routes
* To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, you can add a new /dashboard/settings route by nesting two new folders in the app directory.
* The /dashboard/settings route is composed of three segments:
    * / (Root segment)
    * dashboard (Segment)
    * settings (Leaf segment)

### File Conventions
Next.js provides a set of special files to create UI with specific behavior in nested routes:
* **layout**	Shared UI for a segment and its children
* **page**	Unique UI of a route and make routes publicly accessible
* **loading**	Loading UI for a segment and its children
* **not-found**	Not found UI for a segment and its children
* **error**	Error UI for a segment and its children
* **global-error**	Global Error UI
* **route**	Server-side API endpoint
* **template**	Specialized re-rendered Layout UI
* **default**	Fallback UI for Parallel Routes

### Component Hierarchy
The React components defined in special files of a route segment are rendered in a specific hierarchy:
* layout.js
* template.js
* error.js (React error boundary)
* loading.js (React suspense boundary)
* not-found.js (React error boundary)
* page.js or nested layout.js
In a nested route, the components of a segment will be nested inside the components of its parent segment.

### Colocation
* In addition to special files, you have the option to colocate your own files (e.g. components, styles, tests, etc) inside folders in the app directory.
* This is because while folders define routes, only the contents returned by page.js or route.js are publicly addressable.

### Advanced Routing Patterns
The App Router also provides a set of conventions to help you implement more advanced routing patterns. These include:
* **Parallel Routes:** Allow you to simultaneously show two or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. You can use them for split views that have their own sub-navigation. E.g. Dashboards.
* **Intercepting Routes:** Allow you to intercept a route and show it in the context of another route. You can use these when keeping the context for the current page is important. E.g. Seeing all tasks while editing one task or expanding a photo in a feed.

These patterns allow you to build richer and more complex UIs, democratizing features that were historically complex for small teams and individual developers to implement.

## Defining Routes
### Creating Routes
* Next.js uses a file-system based router where folders are used to define routes.
* Each folder represents a route segment that maps to a URL segment. To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other.
* A special page.js file is used to make route segments publicly accessible.
* .js, .jsx, or .tsx file extensions can be used for special files.
* For example, the **/dashboard/analytics** URL path is not publicly accessible because it does not have a corresponding page.js file. This folder could be used to store components, stylesheets, images, or other colocated files.

### Creating UI
* Special file conventions are used to create UI for each route segment. The most common are pages to show UI unique to a route, and layouts to show UI that is shared across multiple routes.
* For example, to create your first page, add a page.js file inside the app directory and export a React component.

## Pages and Layouts
### Pages
* A page is UI that is unique to a route.
* You can define pages by exporting a component from a page.js file.
* Use nested folders to define a route and a page.js file to make the route publicly accessible.

### Layouts
* A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages.
* On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render. Layouts can also be nested.
* You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout.js file. The component should accept a children prop that will be populated with a child layout (if it exists) or a child page during rendering.
* **Root Layout (Required)**: The root layout is defined at the top level of the app directory and applies to all routes. This layout enables you to modify the initial HTML returned from the server.
* **Nesting Layouts**: Layouts defined inside a folder (e.g. app/dashboard/layout.js) apply to specific route segments and render when those segments are active. By default, layouts in the file hierarchy are nested, which means they wrap child layouts via their children prop.
* You can use Route Groups to opt specific route segments in and out of shared layouts.

### Templates
* Templates are similar to layouts in that they wrap each child layout or page.
* A template can be defined by exporting a default React component from a template.js file. The component should accept a children prop.

### Modifying <head>
* In the app directory, you can modify the <head> HTML elements such as title and meta using the built-in SEO support.
* Metadata can be defined by exporting a metadata object or generateMetadata function in a layout.js or page.js file.

## Linking and Navigating
There are two ways to navigate between routes in Next.js: Using the <pre><Link></pre> Component and Using the useRouter Hook.
**Link Component**:
* Link is a built-in component that extends the HTML <a> tag to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes.
* It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.
* <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
* props available for the Link Component:
  * **href (required)** - The path or URL to navigate to. <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>. href can also accept an object. You can use it by importing it from next/link, and passing a href prop to the component.
  * **replace** - Defaults to false. When true, next/link will replace the current history state instead of adding a new URL into the browserâ€™s history stack.
  * **scroll** - Defaults to true. The default behavior of <Link> is to scroll to the top of a new route or to maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation. When false, next/link will not scroll to the top of the page after a navigation.
  * **prefetch** - Defaults to true. When true, next/link will prefetch the page (denoted by the href) in the background. This is useful for improving the performance of client-side navigations. Any <Link /> in the viewport (initially or through scroll) will be preloaded. Prefetch can be disabled by passing prefetch={false}. Prefetching is only enabled in production.
